A Flutter UI for docket

## Not ready for use

The flutter client is an active playground for me to learn flutter. If I'm able
to learn enough flutter to make something useful, I'm aiming to build a feature
compatible mobile client as the responsive web client has some rough spots that
I'd like to improve on.
